INSTALLATION

1. Download and install all required Ant and dependent packages. Verify
   that each package is properly installed. AntXtras 3.5.0b2 requires Ant
   version 1.8.0/1.8.1/1.8.2/1.8.4 and at least JRE 1.5.

2. Download, verify, and extract a JWare/AntXtras distribution. If you
   are a new AntXtras user, download the binary distribution that includes
   a sample Ant script that you can use to verify your installation.

   * To verify the PGP signature of the downloaded archive, get the
     JWare distribution KEYS from http://purl.net/jware/KEYS

   * If you must manually generate all binaries for your environment,
     download the source-only distribution. The included "ez-build.xml"
     Ant build file can generate a default distribution from the source.
     Be sure you configure the "ez-build.properties" file for your
     environment. Read the AntXtras download web page for the list of 
     required third-party packages before compiling AntXtras.

3. Update your development and Ant run environment to include the MAIN
   AntXtras jar file in your ANT classpath. The required jar is found
   at <ANTXTRAS_HOME>/lib/jw-antxtras.jar. Note that there are actually
   three AntXtras jar files. The second jar 'jw-antxtras-advanced.jar'
   contains very useful but not necessarily everyday components and
   the third jar 'jw-antxtras-antunit.jar' contains components we use to
   test AntXtras itself (and you might find a use for).

4. Verify AntXtras classes are accessible in your ANT runtime environment.
   The easiest way to do this is to try loading the AntXtras antlib using
   the standard Ant declaration; for example:
   <taskdef onerror="failall"
       resource="org/jwaresoftware/antxtras/install/antlib.xml"/>

5. Read the AntXtras Overview on the website for a list of the most used
   antlib components and a set of quick-start examples.
