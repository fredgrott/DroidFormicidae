<p>The general tools for this project used as a modern IDE, apache ant for the 
build, and git.  At bare minimum you need Apache ANT to build this project along with of course 
an install of the JDK.</p>
<p>Some acceptable IDEs are:
<ul>
<li>Eclipse</li>
<li>NetBeans</li>
<li>IntelliJ</li>
</ul>

I have used all three but prefer Eclipse.</p>
